ErlangSSLExample - A simple example of an SSL enabled echo server
---

This demonstrates how a server can be written in erlang that can be started in either SSL mode or non-SSL mode and have the mode be transparent to the data handling code.

To do:
---
.. Add code to demonstrate upgrading non-ssl model connection to ssl-model suing .
.. Add build support for rebar
.. Add demo/unit tests
